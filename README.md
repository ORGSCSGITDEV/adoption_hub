The **Adoption Hub** is an easy to import and modify MS Teams app that leverages Teams as a Platform to ramp up end users on various technology platforms quickly, enabling organizations to realize the breadth and power of their technology. 

Per our most recently published LinkedIn article, we have now enhanced the app to include instructions on how to add a conversational bot, thus the renaming to **Adoption Hub**. We encourage everyone to take advantage of the full solution and follow the instructions in the [Adoption Hub deployment guide](https://github.com/akporzondek/adoption_app/wiki/Deployment-Guide_Adoption-Hub). 

Our first version, the Adoption App (which includes support for GCC tenants), is still available for you to deploy and detailed instructions can be found in the Adoption App deployment guide.

We encourage you to change the name of the app to reflect how you will use it within your organization. Many organizations have adopted the naming convention of **YourOrgNameReady**, **ContosoReady** as an example.

**Feedback Form** - Add a survey with MS Forms to capture end user input on MS Teams or any type of feedback that may be required on other projects and/or technologies.

Now let's paint the picture of how the Adoption Hub can assist with other technologies...

How about hosting any instructor-led trainings that could be offered? Add additional columns to support Vendor selection: Microsoft, Workday, Epic, Cerner, ServiceNow, etc.

Think about adding additional tabs to other technology learning tools that end users can access.
To minimize tabs, consider a single tab pointing to a site with the list/logos/links of supported technology.
