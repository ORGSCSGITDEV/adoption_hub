The **Adoption Hub** is an easy to import and modify MS Teams app that leverages Teams as a Platform to ramp up end users on various technology platforms quickly, enabling organizations to realize the breadth and power of their technology. 

Per our most [recently published LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/adoption-hub-ms-teams-app-just-got-itself-some-upgradesdo-john-pan/?trackingId=rF2tbUOORGe%2FMdPy7hFJVg%3D%3D), we have now enhanced the app to include instructions on how to add a conversational bot, thus the renaming to **Adoption Hub**. We encourage everyone to take advantage of the full solution and follow the instructions in the [Adoption Hub deployment guide](https://github.com/akporzondek/adoption_app/wiki/Deployment-Guide_Adoption-Hub). 

Our first version, the Adoption App (which includes support for GCC tenants), is still available for you to deploy and detailed instructions can be found in the Adoption App deployment guide.

We encourage you to change the name of the app to reflect how you will use it within your organization. Many organizations have adopted the naming convention of **YourOrgNameReady**, **ContosoReady** as an example. Others have created contests to allow their user community to pick the name for the org! What will you name your version of the Adoption Hub?

**Chat** - Add an interactive and customizable natural language bot for answers to commonly asked questions. If you don't have your own bot, consider the **[Adoption Bot](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-adopt-bot)**, or **[Timon](https://sway.office.com/RhKSBJ4TehvB8s5W?ref=Link)**. 

**Technology Home** - Dedicate this tab to your own modern SharePoint communication site. Maybe you already have a landing page for your adoption project? Publish it here  in the Adoption Hub! Can also be great way to redirect your users to other sites or resources as well like a link to open support tickets.
