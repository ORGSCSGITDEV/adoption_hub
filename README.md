The Adoption Hub is an easy to create custom app that leverages Teams as a Platform to ramp up end users on various technology platforms quickly, enabling organizations to realize the breadth and power of their technology.

Now let's paint the picture of how the Adoption App can assist with other technologies...

How about hosting any instructor-led trainings that could be offered? Add additional columns to support Vendor selection: Microsoft, Workday, Epic, Cerner, ServiceNow, etc.

Think about adding additional tabs to other technology learning tools that end users can access.
To minimize tabs, consider a single tab pointing to a site with the list/logos/links of supported technology.
