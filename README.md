# The Adoption Hub: Boost your adoption efforts with a single MS Teams app 

**Note** - Adoption App "V1" vs. Adoption Hub "V2"

* **Adoption App** - The original app that only utilizes personal tabs to curate learning information and is also GCC friendly.
* **Adoption Hub** - The evolved version of the app that now incorporates the use of bots, such as Timon (pictured).

The **Adoption Hub** is an easy to import and modify MS Teams app that leverages Teams as a Platform to ramp up end users on various technology platforms quickly, enabling organizations to realize the breadth and power of their technology. 

Per our most [recently published LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/adoption-hub-ms-teams-app-just-got-itself-some-upgradesdo-john-pan/?trackingId=rF2tbUOORGe%2FMdPy7hFJVg%3D%3D), we have now enhanced the app to include instructions on how to add a conversational bot, thus the renaming to **Adoption Hub**. We encourage everyone to take advantage of the full solution and follow the instructions in the [Adoption Hub deployment guide](https://github.com/akporzondek/adoption_app/wiki/Deployment-Guide_Adoption-Hub). 

Our first version, the Adoption App (which includes support for GCC tenants), is still available for you to deploy and detailed instructions can be found in the Adoption App deployment guide.

We encourage you to change the name of the app to reflect how you will use it within your organization. Many organizations have adopted the naming convention of **YourOrgNameReady**, **ContosoReady** as an example.

**Chat** - Add an interactive and customizable natural language bot for answers to commonly asked questions. If you don't have your own bot, consider the **[Adoption Bot](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-adopt-bot)**, or **[Timon](https://sway.office.com/RhKSBJ4TehvB8s5W?ref=Link)**. 

**Technology Home** - Landing page for IT/IS related topics and procedures related to requests and/or support tickets.

Now let's paint the picture of how the Adoption Hub can assist with other technologies...

How about hosting any instructor-led trainings that could be offered? Add additional columns to support Vendor selection: Microsoft, Workday, Epic, Cerner, ServiceNow, etc.
